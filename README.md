# Uno!
This is the project of team 16 for the course Object Orientated Programming Project - DIT213

We are making uno :)
## Peer review
The main branch *should* always be in a runnable state with the latest finnished and implemented features. 
We have a user guide document with description and an overview of how to play and run the code. 

### known issues
If you use AppWindow.java to start the game, there will be exceptions printed in the terminal, but the game works. We are working on fixing this.
Using AppWIndow, Players are labeled incorrectly, "player 1" is named "player 2" and vice versa.
